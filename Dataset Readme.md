# VISUALIZING REAL WORD DATA
### by Hern√°n Sosa

For this project, we'll use the Dataset we achieved on the last project ('Web Scraping'). This dataset is still on working progress (I'll show why after the intro)

This dataset consists on a history record of all (or the majority) of shows a given artist has given throughout its career.

The data its collected from Discogs webpage and Songkick API. An example with just 15 artists has the following looks: 

# Head

# df.info():

# Number of shows per artist:

![Value Counts](https://github.com/H89Sosa/project-visualizing-real-world-data/blob/master/value_counts.png?raw=true)

## In progress:

We're working on including also the country origin of the artist, for statistical pruposes.

Also the billing price for each venue would be interesting, since it opens the possibilities of studying interesting financial data
